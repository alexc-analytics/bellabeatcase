# Bellabeat Case Study
This case study utilizes various CSV files of FitBit data conduct analysis for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company. Specifically, the data set contains 18 CSV files on about thirty FitBit users including physical activity, heart rate, steps, sleep, and weight from 4/12/2016 to 5/12/2016. The data was uploaded to Google's BigQuery as tables for analysis. 
My project showcases a combindation of different SQL queries such as CASE statements, JOIN clauses, window functions, and averages to generate insights about the dataset.
